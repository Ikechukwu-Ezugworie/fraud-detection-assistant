# Fraud Detection Assistant with Agentic AI

This project presents a fraud detection assistant powered by Agentic AI, designed to autonomously analyze and reason about credit card transactions. Leveraging the ReAct (Reasoning and Acting) framework, the assistant not only detects suspicious activity but also explains its decisions through interpretable reasoning steps. Built on the [Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud), it showcases how Agentic AI systems can combine data-driven insights with dynamic decision-making to improve the accuracy and transparency of fraud detection.
